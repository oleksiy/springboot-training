## Quick Notes

### MVC

|MODEL | VIEW | CONTROLLER|
|:------|:-----|:-----------|
| Model represents the data and nothing else. It is independent of Views and Controllers. | View sends user actions (button clicks, requests) to the controller. Views can be independent from both model and controller or BE the controller, and depend on the model.| Controller provides model data to view and interprets user actions such as button clicks. The controller depends on the view and the model|
